summary: produces a byte pattern that appears 15% less often than its counterparts
description: This test shows that our inline statistical tests easily catch something like a particular byte pattern that appears 15% less often than its counterparts. This case demonstrates the utility of the "gauss sum" test. You will also see a subtle cross appear towards at the top left half of the correlation pruned_byte.rb:# image. The octet 'e' (0b1100101) was chosen because it contains an equal number of set and unset bits.
